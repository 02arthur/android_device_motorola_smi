Motorola SMI
===========================

Motorola Razr i Intel-atom

Repository is not yet a fully working tree. There are still some parts missing or not working.

'SMI-Plus' is only needed for rom building! (to free up space)

Source from Turl, Oxavelar, Motorola, Intel and HazouPH

Still to do for fully working tree:
- Ramdisk build working correctly (using prebuilt for now)
- Audio
- Wifi/gps
- More...?

(Only for CM10.1!!! dec 2013 repo). 

See for information about compiling and setting up a build environment the 'Small tutorial' for more information.

Good luck!
